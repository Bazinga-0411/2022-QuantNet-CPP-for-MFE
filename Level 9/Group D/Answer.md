a)
The code contains references to the functions. The namespaces that house batch data are also. Just above the primary function, they are.

b)
So long as N and Nsim are the same in every trial, the outcomes are the same as in Group C, in my opinion. This suggests that there is a pattern to the random number utilized in trials. (While I am aware that they are not truly random, I still don't anticipate seeing exactly the same behavior in every trial with the identical inputs.) Results are unaffected by SE and SD functions. For any type of option with a given property, SD is often rather steady, whereas SE decreases as Nsim increases.
